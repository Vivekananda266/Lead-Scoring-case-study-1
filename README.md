# Lead Scoring case study
There are quite a few goals for this case study:

   Building a model that predicts and assigns a lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead, such that customers with a higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and customers with a lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.
   The target lead conversion rate is around 80% or more
